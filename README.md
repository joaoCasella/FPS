# FPS

This is the first game that I ever developed. Some things are being refactored

![Gif showing the progress, until this moment](Demo.gif)

## Game Setup

The game is a simple FPS game. It's initial version was developed in a day, and had some rules to be followed. Essentially, it is composed of 3 screens, one for the main menu, other for the game itself and the last for the final game screen. The game logic is simple, based on rounds, and at each round a new wave of enemies spawns. The enemies don't move, just follow your direction to determinate the shooting direction.

## Configurations

The machine used to develop this game was a Acer Nitro 5, with a Intel I7 7700H processor, a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050Ti and 16Gb of RAM. The Unity version used was the 5.0

## Feedback

This is my first 3D game, so any feedbacks and suggestions are apreciated. All I ask is respect :)

## Possible Improvements

My goal is to learn about the engine and its workflow. But still, there are some points of the game itself that could be improved in the game:

- [x] Fix the mouse cursor, that is visible during the gameplay (should be visible only in the menus)
- [x] Fix the leaderboard appearance and logic
- [x] Fix the enemy shots direction (they were suposed to aim at the player)
- [x] Fix the bullet direction (from the player perspective)
- [x] Add a proper crosshair on the player aim
- [x] Save the leaderboard to the persistent storage on change
- [ ] Reduce total project size
- [ ] Standardize the game theme (at the moment, each asset is from a different theme)
- [ ] Add some animations (already possible, for example, in the gun asset)
- [ ] Fix the sound jump when the user switches from the end to the start menu
- [ ] Fix game architecture
- [ ] Add some feedback when the user interacts with something
- [ ] Make the enemies shooting times random (and add more sound variety)
